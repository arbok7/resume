    <h4> The film is well-acted and suitably raw depiction of the horrors of war.</h4>
    <h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
    <img src="./assets/images/Blade runner 2049.jpg" height="200" />
    <h4>Blade Runner 2049 is a deep, technically impeccable film that manages to expand the story of its predecessor,
        pushing it to new heights.</h4>
    <h3>Fight Club</h3>

    <h4>Ohh! I forget the 1st rule of Fight Club. what was that??</h4>
